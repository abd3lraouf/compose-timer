## :scroll: Description
This app is a Timer App that got created for the Android Dev Challenge Week 2 for the Beta launch
of Jetpack Compose. The user can create and manage any amount of timers to track the time.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
With this app, I made first steps with the gesture system of Jetpack Compose. The input of the time
can be done by sliding over the input areas.
In addition, the App integrates reactive flows (namely Kotlin Flows) and has advanced animations for
the remaining time.
